# About The Project

![Image of the application's home screen with two buttons to sign up or log in](https://github.com/Sukhman25K/FlashQuiz/blob/main/HomeScreen.png?raw=true) 

This was my first coding project as part of my A-Level Computer Science examination where I had to solve one of
my client's problems. In this case, I created a revision app with flashcards using Python.
I designed the user interface, modelled the database, and wrote all the code as efficiently as possible.

# Built With
The main and only language used to create this application was Python due to its versatility and adaptability with multiple modules offered. For example, Python's sqlite3 and Tkinter modules allow the implementation of a database and the creation of a user interface in a single language leading to an efficient integration between the two critical properties of the application.

# Getting Started
In order to run the application, you will need to set up the project locally first by following these instructions.

## Prerequisites
Check whether Python is already installed with
```
python --version
```
If Python is not installed, you can do so from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads) by selecting the appropriate installer for your required environment.

## Installation
After setting up Python, you can install the application to your local environment with the following instructions:
1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sukhman25K/FlashQuiz.git
   ```
2. Install any missing Python packages by replacing the name in the command 
   ```
   python -m pip install name
   ```

## Usage
You can run the application when the installation is complete and stored in your local environment. In order to run the application, that can be done in different ways where the first one would be using a terminal. Navigate to the folder where the application is stored and type:
```
python FlashQuiz.py
```

Another way to run the application would be by using an IDLE such as Python's default IDLE or a code editor such as VS code.
