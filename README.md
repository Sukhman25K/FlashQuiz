This was my first coding project as part of my A-Level Computer Science examination where I had to solve one of
my client's problems. In this case, I created a revision app with flashcards using Python.
I designed the user interface, modelled the database, and wrote all the code as efficiently as possible.

# Built With
The main and only language used to create this application was Python.

# Getting Started
